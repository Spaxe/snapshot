Evidence of population declines as a result of climate change is particularly concerning for threatened and endangered species, which may already be at risk. Iconic marine species will continue to attract conservation attention, and under climate change, intervention may be required to help populations persist. Developing adaptation options for iconic species will be challenging, and so much effort has been devoted to reducing non-climate stressors. In some cases, this will be insufficient, and so intervention is the only alternative to extinction. Recent work suggests the shy albatross (*Thalassarche cauta*) will be adversely affected by projected changes in environmental conditions under plausible climate change scenarios. This tool allows exploration of a range of intervention options, and demonstrates the effect on population size. The "Management Reference Level" is a minimum level of population abundance chosen by managers below which some action may be taken to improve population status. The reference level shown here is for illustration purposes only and has not been agreed by managers of this population.
