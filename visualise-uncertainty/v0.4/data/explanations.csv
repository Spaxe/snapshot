No text,The goal in this simulation is to explore the effect of implementing different adaptation options when the number of breeding pairs on the island falls below 5500. ,"In the absence of the environmental effects due to climate change, the population will continue to increase in size, towards the previous carrying capacity of the island. ","Warming temperatures, as projected under climate change, are projected to lead to population decline. Adaptation is needed to reverse this decline.","A reduction in chick mortality can be achieved with an intervention such as disease treatment, which increases the survival of chicks. ",An intervention that also increases juvenile survival leads to a temporary recovery of population size ,"If more chicks can be produced, as might occur if adults could be encouraged by intervention to breed every year, then population recovery also occurs for a short time. ","If each of the three interventions are delayed by five years, due to lack of preparation or implementation delays, the benefit of the intervention is reduced","If the intervention to improve adult survival is implemented after the population has already begun to decline, there is no population benefit, as environmental conditions are such that few chicks are surviving. ","If adult survival is improved via an early adaptation option, then the benefit, in population terms, lasts a longer time than improving adult survival later in the century. "
