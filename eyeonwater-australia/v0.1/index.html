      <h1 class="title">EyeOnWater Sketchplots</h1>
      <p>Xavier Ho | status: <em>draft</em> | updated <timee>2017.11.05</time></p>
      <p>
        This is a series of data sketches and plotting explorations, which I call
        sketchplots. The goal is to dive deep into <a href="http://www.eyeonwater.org/">EyeOnWater</a>
        colour data and visualise interesting trends. EyeOnWater is a citizen
        science intitiative with an app that supports water colour measurement
        anyone can do on a smartphone. Data is <a href="http://www.citclops.eu/search/welcome.php">open access</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I downloaded the entire historical colour dataset, which ranges from
        1930 - 2013. The colour measurements were probably taken during voyages
        across the sea. They are indexed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forel-Ule_scale">Forel-Ule</a>.
      </p>

      <div id="forel-ule">
        <h2 class="title">The Forel-Ule Index</h2>
        <svg width="800" height="60"></svg>
        <p class="subtitle">Each colour is mapped to an index number</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The Forel-Ule index is a rough but useful indicator for the water type.
        While there are many factors that may result in the same colour, we can
        use it as a baseline the compare nonetheless, and it is easy to measure.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we group nearby measurements and display the most recent
        measurements, it look like this on the world map. Hover over each
        hexagon to see the data point.

      <div id="water-map">
        <svg width="900" height="600"></svg>
        <p class="subtitle">Historical water colours collected between 1930 - 2013</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The plot is drawn in chronological order, from the earliest to the
        latest.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can plot the data points over time to see the frequency of colours
        over time.
      </p>

      <div id="fu-distribution">
        <svg width="900" height="450"></svg>
        <p class="subtitle">Distribution of Forel-Ule colour measured over time</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The distribution of colours is largely found in the blue-aqua colour,
        and there was a significant amount of data collected between 1970 and
        2000.
      </p>

      <h1>EyeOnWater Australia</h1>

      <p>
        We will focus on Australia with the EyeOnWater data from 2015 onwards.
        The scatterplot below is the time distribution of each measurement.
        Hover over each point to see correlating data between plots.
      </p>

      <div id="aus-map">
        <svg id="aus-map-extent" width="600" height="500"></svg>
        <svg id="aus-map-timeline" width="600" height="100"></svg>
        <p class="subtitle">EyeOnWater data in Australia, 2015 - 2017</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Interestingly, most of the measurements in the last yaer were done in
        Melbourne, while most of the measurements done in 2016 were in Brisbane.
